WIP: Project for house automation in Common Lisp: House automation bus (hab)

*** House Automation for Common Lisp

****  Motivation

I use home automation in my home. Currently utilizing [[https://www.openhab.org/][openHAB]]. While openHAB has many features and supports many devices and so on, it is also a heavy beast.

So my aim was to eventually replace openHAB. There are a few things still missing to do this. The current state of the cl-hab project lacks the following for me to be able to replace openHAB:

- support for KNX
- a REST interface
- a UI to interact with the system

**** What does cl-hab currently do
